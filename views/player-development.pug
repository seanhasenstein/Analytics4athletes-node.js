				p Example Player Development sheet for a guard:
				ul
					li The primary focus points are on 9 different areas on the floor.
					li The breakdown of a playerâ€™s shooting ability covers quantities and percentages for assisted/non-assisted shots.
					li Shots off zero dribbles to any number of dribbles before the shot.
					li Shots at anytime in the shot clock.
					li Contested/non-contested shots.
					li Touches in the possession before the shots.
					li Upon request, defensive stats can be analyzed and included in a Player Development sheet.
					li Thru Player Development statistics you get the best opportunity to fully analyze an athlete, giving you the opportunity to create a specific plan for the athlete, and in the end helping them improve upon the areas where they need it the most.
